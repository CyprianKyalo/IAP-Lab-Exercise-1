## How to Deploy

### To deploy this application, you need to pre-install a server on your local machine.
In the building of the application I have used the Apache server and the MySQL database.
Download XAMPP on your machine to get both the Apache server and the MySQL database.
Ensure both are running successfully.
Clone this repository under Xampp/htdocs.
Create a database(name of your choice) and import my database, iap_app.sql.
After that you can successfully launch the application by typing Localhost/App/Signup.php to navigate to the register page.
